 Here's why you should stay away from Safemoon. In case you didn't know, Safemoon is basically a Ponzi scheme in crypto form. The previous owners and the previous holders keep getting richer as new people keep buying the coin. They basically charged 10% where 5% is kicked back to the owners and all the previous coin holders. And the other 5% is used to buy BNB so that the whole thing doesn't fall apart. This contract combination has serious sharia concerns. BNB is also questionable as a coin itself. And if people stop buying Safemoon then guess what happens. BEEW! Stay away, stay safe and always do your research on a LONOS VEST. SELLAEMS!
